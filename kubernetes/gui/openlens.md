# Openlens (Graphical Interface - client) 

## Why not use lens ?

```
Interestingly the source of lens is opensource, but the binary is freeware.
As of 2023 there is a license key needed 

But OpenLens - client (binary) is opensource, so we use that one 
```

## Install openlens (Windows) 

```
# The easiest way to do so on windows is:
```

```
winget install openlens 
```

```
After that it will be available from Windows (not cmd.exe)
```
